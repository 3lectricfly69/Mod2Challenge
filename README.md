# Mod2Challenge
After reviewing the mockup and guidlines of this Module 2 Challenge, I structured the HTML page to fit the structure of the portfolio with the perspective of what an employer wants so that they can properly review samples of my work to see if I'm a good canidate. 
After properly forming a structure of the page with HTML, I then utilized CSS to bring style to the page that was necessary to make it more appealing by using features such as background color, grid template, and border-radiuses.
